# HIPAA Compliance Checker #

The HIPAA Compliance Checker is a formal translation of HIPAA into Prolog.  The Prolog translation can be executed and reports whether a given action complies with HIPAA.  The demonstration version of the site is available at http://www.tcs-trddc.com/privacy/HIPAA/.

### Coverage ###

The current implementation checks compliance with HIPAA rules 160.502 and 164.506 of the _HIPAA Administrative Simplification, Regulation Text_: 45 CFR Parts 160, 162, and 164 (Unofficial Version, as amended through February 16, 2006)  [PDF 769KB](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/AdminSimpRegText.pdf)

We translate the HIPAA regulation into Prolog one statement at a time.  You can verify our translation by examining the [side-by-side comparison](http://www.tcs-trddc.com/privacy/source_files.htm).  If you find any errors, please [file an issue](http://code.google.com/p/hipaa/issues/entry) using our issue tracker.
